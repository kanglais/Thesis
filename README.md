# MSc Thesis

## Introduction

This is the code used for my MSc Thesis - a data analysis of tweets during the United States elections in 2016. 
This was an attempt to find out whether or not users on twitter were staying within their own 'bubbles' of previously formed opinions and, therefore, information- for instance, Republicans only talking to Republicans, and Democrats to Democrats. 

## Tweets

The tweets were collected from the summer of 2016 to the spring of 2017. In order to be included, tweets had to make use of hashtags that were popular around the election (eg, #maga) or include replies or retweets or references to one of the two candidates.
