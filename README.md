# Thesis

MsC Thesis on a data analysis of tweets during the United States elections in 2016. 
An attempt to find out whether or not users on twitter were staying within their own 'bubbles' of previously formed opinions and, therefore, information- for instance, Republicans only talking to Republicans, and Democrats to Democrats.
